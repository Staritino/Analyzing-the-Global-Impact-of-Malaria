# Analyzing-the-Global-Impact-of-Malaria

Malaria continues to be a significant global health challenge, affecting millions and contributing significantly to mortality worldwide. This project is dedicated to understanding the global impact of malaria through comprehensive data visualizations. We aim to collect and analyze malaria data primarily sourced from the WHO database, encompassing historical incidence rates, mortality statistics, demographic variables, and regional disparities. Our approach involves a detailed analysis to reveal critical trends and patterns. Furthermore, we have developed three predictive models - linear model, decision tree, and random forest, using variables such as year, incidence rates, and estimated cases, to forecast malaria mortality.  The best performing model is the random forest with an accuracy of about 97%. Through this project, we contribute meaningful insights into the fight against malaria, potentially aiding formulation of more effective strategies to combat this persistent disease
