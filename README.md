# Analyzing-the-Global-Impact-of-Malaria

Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, affecting millions and contributing substantially to mortality worldwide. This project focuses on understanding malariaâ€™s global impact through comprehensive data visualizations, utilizing data primarily sourced from the WHO database. We analyze historical incidence rates, mortality statistics, demographic variables, and regional disparities. Our detailed approach reveals critical trends and patterns. Additionally, we have developed three predictive models - a linear model, a decision tree, and a random forest - using variables such as year, incidence rates, and estimated cases to forecast malaria mortality.  The random forest emerged as the most accurate, with approximately 96% accuracy. This project aims to provide insights into the fight against malaria, potentially guiding the development of more effective strategies to tackle this persistent disease.
